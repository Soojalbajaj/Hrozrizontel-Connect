Users will be able to join meetings by entering a meeting ID or a URL. Once they're in a meeting, they can control their audio and video settings, share their screen, and chat with other participants.
We'll make sure that users' information and meetings are protected from hackers by using secure connections and encrypting data. Only people who are supposed to be in a meeting will be able to get in.
